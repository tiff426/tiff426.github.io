        <h1>assignment 1</h1>
        <p class="desc">for this assignment, my approach was that I uploaded the notebook to Google Colab, then I followed the questions to produce the answers. i coded in python and utilized pandas as well as matplotlib, to aid in plotting. for other questions related to the optimal location and probability, i used geometry, algebra, and probability</p>

        <p class="desc">i really tried my best i dont really understand why the functionality is not working but the logic makes snese i feel liek myimplementation of the actual functions shows that i know general understanding but i jsut have never used flask or anythign before sorry</p>
        <p>also sorry to play the video you have to eihter play it in picture in picture mode or show all controls then play sorry</p>

        <p class="desc">for this assignment, my approach was that I uploaded the notebook to VSCode, then I followed the questions to produce the answers. i coded in python and utilized pandas as well as matplotlib, to aid in plotting. i utilized knowledge from cs132 to perform the steps of svd, while also utiliing class code and notes to complete my implementation and analyze the results</p>

        <p class="desc">my approach for this assignment was that i utilized content from lecture and lab to implement lsa. first, i loaded the required dataset, created my voctorizer, stemmed the data, created my term to doc matrix, centered the data, then used truncated SVD to perform the actual lsa. then, i could use this processed data with my query, which i also processed to be latent, to determien the top 5 documents based on cosine similarity. then, i used chart.js to plot.</p>

        <h1>assignment 5</h1>
        <p class="desc">for this assignment, my approach was that I uploaded the notebook to VSCode, then i implemented the empty "to do" functions in order to implement knn, preprocessing, and validation from scratch. for conceptual as well as technical assistance, i found the course slides from lecture useful as well as the lab</p>
