        <h1>assignment 1</h1>
        <p class="desc">for this assignment, my approach was that I uploaded the notebook to Google Colab, then I followed the questions to produce the answers. i coded in python and utilized pandas as well as matplotlib, to aid in plotting. for other questions related to the optimal location and probability, i used geometry, algebra, and probability</p>

        <p class="desc">my approach for this assignment was that i utilized content from lecture and lab to implement lsa. first, i loaded the required dataset, created my voctorizer, stemmed the data, created my term to doc matrix, centered the data, then used truncated SVD to perform the actual lsa. then, i could use this processed data with my query, which i also processed to be latent, to determien the top 5 documents based on cosine similarity. then, i used chart.js to plot.</p>
